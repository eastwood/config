# All Things Configuration
---

Just my random bunch of configuration files that I use day to day. 
Constantly toying with a lot of this stuff, documentation may get out of date. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.

## Emacs Configuration

The `emacs/init.el` file contains my Emacs configuration, which includes package management with `use-package`, custom functions, and keybindings tailored for my workflow. It supports various programming languages and tools like `magit`, `org-mode`, and `vterm`.

## Vim Configuration

The `vim/init.lua` file is my Neovim configuration, utilizing the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager. It includes settings for appearance, key mappings, and plugins such as `gitsigns.nvim`, `fzf`, and `nvim-treesitter` for enhanced code navigation and editing.
